1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
Ans:-
With writing function we can reuse code in program and we can more oftenly write clear code and we can break in small pices instead of writing 
big complex code or program.

2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?
Ans:-
Function runs when it is called on needs , specification does not mean you are asking function to work .

3. What statement creates a function?
Ans:-
when we are writing function we can use def to define a function and then we can given our desired name for function after def.

4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?
Ans:-
Function is pice of defined code written for certain objective while function call is process to run function for desired output.

5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?
Ans:-
There are only once global scope in python program , and each function's definition creats new local scopes so there can be many local scopes in python.

6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?
Ans:-
Variable in local scopes in python are destroyed when function calls return , and are not acesible anymore. beacuse python uses garbeg collector to automatically reclaim 
memory used by objects , that are no longer accible in program.

7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?
Ans:-
return is value provide to caller by a function when it erminates .it is output of the function and can be assigned to a variable or used in an expression.

8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?
Ans:-
If there is no return value paython returns none value automatically , when a function terminates without executing return statement , python automatically 
returns that no value has been returned

9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?
Ans:-
To make a global variable refer to a function we can use we can use global variable before variable name as:-

x=10
def fofa():
    global x
    x=20
    print("Inside function:",x)
    
print("Before function call",x)
fofa()
print("After function call",x)

10. What is the data type of None?
Ans:-
Data type of none in python is Nonetype.


11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?
Ans:-
import areallyourpetsnamederic , try to import a module named areallyourpetsnamederic , but if there is such module it will raise import error.

13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?
Ans:-
In python there there is way to handle errors as well , we can handle errors by using try and except methos as below.

try:
(#we can write function or program that might have some error)
except Exception as e:
("this will be your output of error occured")

14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?
Ans:-
try cluse eclosed the code that might raised exception.
except cluse handle the errors and exception the caused to be a smoooth running of program instead of creashing by an error of exception/
